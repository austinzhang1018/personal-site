This project was started in the summer of 2017 so I could help teach myself how to write CSS, HTML, and javascript. I use the Jekyll framework to automatically generate blog posts, but the styling and layout of the page are customized by me using plain CSS and HTML. Below are some blog posts about the progress of this site.
