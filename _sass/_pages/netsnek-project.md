I started this project in February 2017. I decided to work on this because I really liked playing the game BMTron with my friends, but found it uncomfortable to play with more than a few people since everyone had to play on the same keyboard. I couldn't find any networked Tron games online so I decided to make my own.

This project is written in Java and uses sockets for connections. Currently, the project can only be run in a terminal and only after editing a file to include the server IP, but I plan on writing a GUI with rooms and user hosted games. The game is currently playable with some tweaking and technical knowlege, but the end goal is to develop it into a standalone JAR application that anyone can run.
