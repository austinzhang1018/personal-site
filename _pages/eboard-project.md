This project was started in fall 2016. A friend and I saw ads for electric skateboards online and thought eboards were a neat idea. However, we were appalled by the 1000+ dollar pricetags. Using a project grant from our school, we began working on building and designing our own electric skateboard using hobby RC parts and our school’s 3D printer. When we finish our build, we’ll publish the design online and depending on interest, may release a Kickstarter for a low-cost electric skateboard kit. The overall goal of this project and electric skateboards, in general, is to solve the “last mile” problem. The last mile transportation problem is the problem of public transportation. Although public transportation is great in that it’s cheap and environmentally friendly, people often don’t use public transportation because stops are too far away from their destinations. Bringing a bike is difficult on buses and subways and parking a bike outside is accompanied by a high risk of theft. A skateboard is small and portable, making it a good candidate for taking on public transportation. However, skateboarding is more taxing than biking and can be quite dangerous on steep inclines. The electric skateboard solves all these issues by allowing people to easily travel on public transit systems as well as the “last mile” easily. Electric skateboards nowadays are extremely expensive, with almost all high-end models over $1000. The goal of this project is to release a product or detailed design for a lightweight electric skateboard with high-end performance under $400.
