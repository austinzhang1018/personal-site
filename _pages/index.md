## Welcome to my personal website. I use this site mainly as a blog and a showcase for some of the projects I've been working on.

### About Me

I'm a nineteen-year-old Dartmouth student from Columbus Ohio.

I enjoy programming, music, investing, basketball, and more.

Use the navbar to view my projects, contact page, posts.

Some of my favorite applications for programming are Visual Studio Code (Atom is OK but I like VSCode better), IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, and Ubuntu for Windows (I wish I had a mac).

I'm excited to work with DALI because I love collaborating with people on projects. While working by yourself is also fun, I love discussing and brainstorming ideas with others.

This is a modified version of a personal site that I started back in 2017 that I used as a personal blog. This site was created using a mixture of ruby, css, html, and javascript. This site uses a framework called Jekyll, created by the people behind github. Jekyll allows for the user to build customized HTML and CSS templates while writing actual content in markdown. This allows for easier upkeep while also maintaining a coding aspect. I used a CSS template called Pixyll for this site. However, I modified the template to work the plugins and layout that I wanted for my site. I also did work in HTML and some javascript so I could implement more features such as google analytics.
