## Welcome to my personal website. While somewhat inactive recently, I use this site mainly as a blog and a showcase for some of the projects I've been working on.

### About Me

I'm a twenty-year-old Dartmouth student from Columbus Ohio.

I enjoy programming, music, investing, basketball, and more.
