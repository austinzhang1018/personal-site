This project started as an English capstone for my literature of social justice class. Originally, it was just going to be a calculator where you typed in some basic information: race, sex, family income, and it told you how privileged you most likely are based on different factors associated with info from those groups. However, because it was an English project, I decided to alter my original idea into a choose your own adventure story. I ended up building a framework for creating choose your own adventure games based on probabilities instead of always following the same path. For example, if you select your starting race as White, you're more likely to be born into a higher income family than if you selected your starting race as African American. These probabilities are based on figures pulled mostly from 2010 US census data and the Pew Research Center. Your starting income affects your likelihood of going to a good school district or private school, which affects whether you're going to go to college, and so on. In this manner, I wanted to highlight how racism and sexism effect class in real life.
