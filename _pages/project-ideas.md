## These are a few random ideas I've had that are either too time consuming for me to start or too complex for me to begin.

1. Automatic snack dispenser for advisory snacks
- Each person would have their own individual pin number and the dispenser would probably be controlled using an arduino. I'd be able to dispense some uniformly shaped snack such as a granola bar. You could keep track of how many snacks each person has taken and have a cooldown timer between dispenses to prevent people from taking too many snacks at once.

2. Improved bus system design
- People would be able to call buses, similar to an uber, but to a specific bus stop and would be able to track the positions of busses through GPS systems. There would also be pay stations at bus stops that would automatically call busses when tickets are purchased (this is for people without smartphones and the payment part is to prevent people from calling busses when not needed). Instead of having set bus routes, an AI automatically updates bus routes to hit different spots according to the number of people waiting at stops and where people need to go. This way, bus routes would be significantly more efficient.

3. Smartphone app to allow people to hear their surroundings when listening to music
- I've found that while listening to music, it's annoying to have to take out an earbud whenever someone is talking to you or you want to hear something. This problem could be solved by running an app in the background that uses the microphone in a phone or headset to listen for human speech or loud noises, and instead of taking out your earbuds for situational awareness, a program automatically picks out what you want to hear- speech or loud noises- and overlays it on top of your music.
