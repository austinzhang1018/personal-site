The first day of our journey was rather uneventful. After packing all of our supplies, we picked Abhi up who just returned from St. Louis. The drive to our eventual destination of Olean was fairly scenic, but much of it was clouded by rain and thunderstorms which proved quite the impediment. After 5 hours and crossing two state lines, we finally arrived at Olean, making it just in time to a restaurant before itâ€™s closing time.

Here are some pictures of our drive.
