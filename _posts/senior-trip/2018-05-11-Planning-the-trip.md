This trip took a lot of planning regarding places to stay, setting up activities, and the overall itinerary. So after several group meetings at Starbucks and meetings with our parents to finalize everything, we finally finished our plan. On Saturday we are leaving around 3 pm to go to Olean and spend the night at a hotel. Sunday we are driving to the White Mountains in New Hampshire and that evening we will set up our tent at the camping ground. After camping that night, we will hike Franconia trail during the day (9-hour trail). On Tuesday, we will go fishing, pack up our camping site, and drive to Mount Washington. Wednesday we will hike up Mount Washington. Thursday we will hike the lonesome lake trails and go fishing and in the evening drive to Maine. Friday we will watch the sunrise over Cape Elizabeth, spend a day in new york and then head home!
