We spent the second day of our journey almost entirely on the road except for rest stops and roads. This time we traveled from last night's stop at Olean NY to our destination in the White Mountains, Lafayette Campground. We got up a little late today, around 9 in the morning. We planned to leave at 9, but we left instead at 10. We drove all the way to Syracuse, only stopping once to take a picture at a scenic overlook, shown below.

Afterwards, we continued to Syracuse, stopping to eat at Dinosaur BBQ. Although we didn't snap a picture of our food, we did get a photo of the aftermath.

We continued northeast, passing through Vermont stopping for dinner in Hanover. Following a short drive to our campground, we setup our tent, built a small campfire, and bear-bagged all of our food. Unfortunately we didn't have time to fish today, but we're planning on doing it either tomorrow after our hike or before we drive up to Mount Washington. Tomorrow we'll tackle the Franconia Ridge Trail, one of the two large hikes we have planned for this trip.
